## Overview

At Visby, a startup I joined from 2018 to 2020, we were researching a potential codec for live-captured holographic video, or video with 6 degrees of freedom using [light fields](https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/light/).

I worked on the decoder side, which loads encoded light field video data from disk, renders each frame of the video based on the viewerâ€™s position and orientation at any given moment, and serves it to a 3D spatial display (such as a VR headset or a [Looking Glass display](https://lookingglassfactory.com/16-spatial-oled)) at a target rate of 30 FPS.

Other things I worked on included designing an ETL system for collecting data on internal metrics, porting our experience into Unity, and assisting with the creation of an API for a partner company.
 
Some technologies I had to become familiar with on the fly included ffmpeg, libjpeg, SIMD and multithreading, and CUDA.
