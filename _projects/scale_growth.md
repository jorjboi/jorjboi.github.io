## Overview
To become familiar with working with VOPs in Houdini, I created a scale growth effect. I can see the benefits of VOPs over scripting in VEX, especially when effects require some nosie and an art-directable organic quality.

I first use the distance attribute with added noise to drive the growth effect. The growth factor is used to control the `pscale` of the scales over time, causing them to appear. To give the growth a more organic quality, I also add noise to the normals and a spring effect to give it some jiggle.

## Process
The growth region is generated by measuring the distance of each point from two different points placed near the geometry, and using the frame number to drive the `srcmax` value of the distance measurement. Another option I tried was using a Pyro Source Spread simulation, but found this to be simpler. 

I then use an attribute blur to make the transition region smoother and more gradual.
