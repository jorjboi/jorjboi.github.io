## Overview
I've always been fascinated with how technical artists create art-directable fur and hair workflows for movies. For this project, I took a peek behind the curtain by following a creature grooming course by Luis Cadavid, and learned how to set up a procedural fur grooming system using Houdini’s guide groom tools and VEX.

I’m very excited about how it came out, and I’m hoping to try rendering these results soon.
